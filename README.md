- Hi, Iâ€™m @Dustman7

- I'm a junior Full-Stack-Developper who is trying sooner or later, to make a video game, i am in Zone01 in the meantime finishing my cursus and learning on the side some Unreal Engine 5 with c++ and blueprint usage.
- I'm for now, not developping around github, just pushing elements that are finished or not, maybe later on ðŸ‘€
